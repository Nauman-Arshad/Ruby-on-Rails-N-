Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.[3]\r\n\r\nAfter a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011.[4] It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community of contributors.[5]"], ["created_at", "2021-08-27 16:33:51.747775"], ["updated_at", "2021-08-27 16:33:51.747775"]]
